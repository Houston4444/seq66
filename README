"Seq66" is a refactoring of the Qt-based version "Sequencer64" for better use of
C++ and for removing a lot of krufty buildup.  With all the work that has been
done on it, "Seq66" is now the best-supported version of "Sequencer64". Windows
users can get an installer package on GitHub at

   https://github.com/ahlstromcj/sequencer64-packages/blob/master/seq66/0.90/seq66_setup_0.90.6.exe

Major changes:

    -   User interface:
        -   Removed the Gtkmm user-interface; using Qt 5 since its cross-platform
            support seems more complete.  Removed the "grid of sets" feature in
            favor of unlimited external grid windows.
        -   Added tabs for management of sets, mute-groups, Song mode, pattern
            editing, event-editing, and play-lists.
        -   Added a live frame using buttons to match Qt theming. The original
            implementation is available as a "user" option.
        -   A color for each sequence can be chosen to make it more
            The color is saved in a SeqSpec associated with the track.
    -   Configuration files:
        -   Separated MIDI control and mute-group setting into their own files,
            with support for hex notation.
        -   Supported configuration files: ".rc", ".usr", ".ctrl", ".mutes", and
            ".playlist".
        -   Unified keystroke control and MIDI control into a ".ctrl" file. It
            defines MIDI In controls for controlling Seq66, and MIDI Out controls
            for displaying Seq66 status in grid controllers (e.g.  LaunchPad).
            Basic 4x8 and 8x8 ".ctrl" files for the Launchpad Mini are provided.
    -   Internal:
        -   More consistent use of modern C++, including lambda functions.
        -   Additional performer callbacks to reduce the need for polling in the
            user-interface.
    -   Non Session Manager.  Working on support for this manager. Refactored
        startup and exiting to support session management.

Seq66 has builds for ALSA/JACK, PortMidi, Windows, and a command-line/daemon.
Here are the executables that can be built:

Linux ALSA/JACK support: Seq66qt5/qseq66
Linux qmake/rtmidi: Seq66qt5/qrseq66
Linux daemon: Seq66cli/seq66cli
Windows qmake/portmidi: Seq66qt5/qpseq66.exe

Seq66 uses a Qt 5 user-interface based on Kepler34 and the Seq66 "rtmidi"
(Linux) and "portmidi" (Windows) engines.  MIDI devices are detected,
inaccessible devices are ignored, and playback (e.g. to the Windows wavetable
synthesizer) work. It is built easily via Qt Creator or qmake, using MingW.
The Qt 5 GUI is the only official GUI of Seq66.

See the INSTALL file for build-from-source instructions for Linux or Windows,
and using a conventional source tarball.

Recent changes:

    -   Version 0.90.6:
        -   Fixed issue #19 where recording notes caused a segfault.
    -   Version 0.90.5:
        -   More refactoring to improve Windows builds and fix deadlocks and
            playback on a default Windows 10 install.
        -   Added code to implement Song/Live and JACK Transport key toggles.
        -   MIDI control improved for control and for status display by
            devices like the Launchpad Mini, using new "ctrl" files.
        -   Fixes:
            -   Fixed a bug using millitime() instead of microtime().
            -   Issue #13, data and event/trigger panes not reflecting event
                changes.  Change handling improved in general with more
                performer callbacks.
            -   The data pane was some pixels off in the tabbed edit-frame.
            -   Fix a lot of issue with using sets and an 8x8 Seq66 grid.
        -   Improved error-handling and reporting.
