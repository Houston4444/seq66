README for Seq66 0.91.0 (Sequencer64 refactored for C++/14 and Qt 5)

"Seq66" is a refactoring of the Qt-based version "Sequencer64" for better use of
C++ and for removing a lot of krufty buildup.  With all the work that has been
done on it, "Seq66" is now the best-supported version of "Sequencer64". Windows
users can get a portable or installer package on GitHub at

   https://github.com/ahlstromcj/sequencer64-packages/blob/master/seq66/0.90/seq66_setup_0.90.5.exe

Major changes:

    -   User interface:
        -   Removed the Gtkmm user-interface; using Qt 5 since its cross-platform
            support seems more complete.  Removed the "grid of sets" feature in
            favor of unlimited external grid windows.
        -   Added tabs for management of sets, mute-groups, Song mode, pattern
            editing, event-editing, and play-lists.
        -   Added a live frame using buttons to match Qt theming. The original
            implementation is available as a "user" option.
        -   A color for each sequence can be chosen to make it more
            The color is saved in a SeqSpec associated with the track.
    -   Configuration files:
        -   Separated MIDI control and mute-group setting into their own files,
            with support for hex notation.
        -   Supported configuration files: ".rc", ".usr", ".ctrl", ".mutes", and
            ".playlist".
        -   Unified keystroke control and MIDI control into a ".ctrl" file. It
            defines MIDI In controls for controlling Seq66, and MIDI Out controls
            for displaying Seq66 status in grid controllers (e.g.  LaunchPad).
            Basic 4x8 and 8x8 ".ctrl" files for the Launchpad Mini are provided.
    -   Internal:
        -   More consistent use of modern C++, including lambda functions.
        -   Additional performer callbacks to reduce the need for polling in the
            user-interface.
    -   Non Session Manager.  Working on support for this manager. Refactored
        startup and exiting to support session management.

Seq66 has builds for ALSA/JACK, PortMidi, Windows, and a command-line/daemon.
Here are the executables that can be built:

Linux ALSA/JACK support: Seq66qt5/qseq66
Linux qmake/rtmidi: Seq66qt5/qrseq66
Linux daemon: Seq66cli/seq66cli
Windows qmake/portmidi: Seq66qt5/qpseq66.exe

Seq66 uses a Qt 5 user-interface based on Kepler34 and the Seq66 "rtmidi"
(Linux) and "portmidi" (Windows) engines.  MIDI devices are detected,
inaccessible devices are ignored, and playback (e.g. to the Windows wavetable
synthesizer) work. It is built easily via Qt Creator or qmake, using MingW.
The Qt 5 GUI is the only official GUI of Seq66.

See the INSTALL file for build-from-source instructions for Linux or Windows,
and using a conventional source tarball.

Recent changes:

    -   Version 0.91.0:
        -   Getting serious about Non Session Manager support.
    -   Version 0.90.5:
        -   More refactoring to improve Windows builds and fix deadlocks and
            playback on a default Windows 10 install.
        -   Added code to implement Song/Live and JACK Transport key toggles.
        -   MIDI control improved for control and for status display by
            devices like the Launchpad Mini, using new "ctrl" files.
        -   Fixes:
            -   Fixed a bug using millitime() instead of microtime().
            -   Issue #13, data and event/trigger panes not reflecting event
                changes.  Change handling improved in general with more
                performer callbacks.
            -   The data pane was some pixels off in the tabbed edit-frame.
            -   Fix a lot of issue with using sets and an 8x8 Seq66 grid.
        -   Improved error-handling and reporting.
    -   Version 0.90.4:
        -   Some refactoring to improve Windows builds.
    -   Version 0.90.3:
        -   Added signal handling (e.g. for nsm-proxy) from user falkTX.
            Used in the CLI and Qt versions to trigger file save and
            application exit.
        -   Added code to define the engine used and the exact "uname a-" of the
            operating system on which the build was done, for the --version
            option.
        -   Fixed issue #5 to save/restore note-on resumes and get them
            working in Live mode and Song mode.
        -   Fixed issues with perfoll and grid-button rendering, synch between
            button and seqedit mute status, growing notes in the seqroll, and
            more.
        -   Added writing of blank [midi-control-out] section.
        -   Fixed flickering when muting/unmuting patterns via keystrokes.
