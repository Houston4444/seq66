While doing this port, we are separating related clumps of code into
subdirectories of libseq66/include and libseq66/src, so that it is easier to
understand the various groups of functionality represented by the cpp and hpp
files.

.       = libseq66/include:         Used for generic code and app-limits.
cfg     = libseq66/include/cfg:     For configuration data and files.
ctrl    = libseq66/include/ctrl:    Code for keyboard and MIDI control of play.
midi    = libseq66/include/midi:    Code for basic MIDI data and structures.
play    = libseq66/include/play:    Code used for patterns and playback.
qt      = libseq66/include/qt:      Minor items specific to Qt usage.
os      = libseq66/include/os:      Utility code for Linux/Mac/Windows.
util    = libseq66/include/util:    Code for calculations, strings, files, etc.

We are also changing the names of some of the classes, mostly to reduce the
number of underscores and enforce more uniform naming for the classes.

# vim: sw=4 ts=4 wm=4 et ft=sh
