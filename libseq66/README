While doing this port, we are separating related clumps of code into
subdirectories of libseq66/include and libseq66/src, so that it is easier to
understand the various groups of functionality represented by the cpp and hpp
files.

.       = libseq66/include:         Used for generic code and app-limits.
cfg     = libseq66/include/cfg:     For configuration items and file handling.
ctrl    = libseq66/include/ctrl:    Code for keyboard and MIDI control of play.
midi    = libseq66/include/midi:    Code for MIDI data and data structures.
play    = libseq66/include/play:    Code used for sequences and playback.
qt      = libseq66/include/qt:      Minor items specific to Qt usage.
unix    = libseq66/include/unix:    Code for Linux/Mac, including JACK.
util    = libseq66/include/util:    Code for calculations, strings, files, etc.

We are also changing the names of some of the classes, mostly to reduce the
number of underscores and enforce more uniform naming for the classes.

# vim: sw=4 ts=4 wm=4 et ft=sh
