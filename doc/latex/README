README for Sequencer66 LaTeX
Chris Ahlstrom
2019-08-13 to 2019-08-13

This directory holds the documentation for Sequencer66.  The documentation is
part of the project, and not a separate project.

In addition, some basic documentation is not transferred from sequencer64-doc to
here.  Thus, sometimes we will refer the reader to that project for background
information.
