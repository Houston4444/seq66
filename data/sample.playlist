# Seq66 0.90.0 (and above) playlist file
#
# data/sample.playlist
# Written on 2019-08-22
#
# This file holds a playlist for Seq66. It consists of one
# or more '[playlist]' sections.  Each section has a user-specified
# number.  This number should range from 0 to 127, but it can go
# higher if the user doesn't need to use MIDI control to select
# a playlist. Ultimately, the playlists are sorted by this number.
#
# Next comes a display name for this list, with or without quotes.
#
# Next comes the name of the directory, always using the UNIX-style
# separator, a forward slash (solidus).  It can optionally be
# terminated with a slash.
#
# The last item is a line containing the MIDI song-control number,
# followed by the name of the MIDI files.  They are sorted by the
# control number, starting from 0.  They can be simple 'base.ext'
# file-names; the playlist directory will be prepended before the
# song is accessed.
#
# If the MIDI file-name already has a directory name, that will be
# used instead.
#
# The [comments] section can document this file.  Lines starting
# with '#' are ignored.  Blank lines are ignored.  Show a
# blank line by adding a space character to the line.

This sample play-list file contains two playlists.  One for
demo ditties, and one for more realistic songs.  These songs
are found in the contrib/midi directory.  You may need to
change that directory name for both of the playlists if you
have a different setup than the developers.
