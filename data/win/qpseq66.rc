# This file holds the main configuration options for Seq66.
# It loosely follows the format of the seq24 'rc' configuration
# file, but adds some new options, and is no longer compatible.

[midi-clock]

# The first line indicates the number of MIDI busses defined.
# Each buss line contains the buss (re 0) and the clock status of
# that buss.  0 = MIDI Clock is off; 1 = MIDI Clock on, and Song
# Position and MIDI Continue will be sent, if needed; 2 = MIDI
# Clock Modulo, where MIDI clocking will not begin until the song
# position reaches the start modulo value [midi-clock-mod-ticks].
# A value of -1 indicates that the output port is totally
# disabled.  One can set this value manually for devices that are
# present, but not available, perhaps because another application
# has exclusive access to the device (e.g. on Windows).

2    # number of MIDI clocks (output busses)

# Output buss name: [0] 0:0 PortMidi:Microsoft MIDI Mapper
0 0   # buss number, clock status
# Output buss name: [1] 1:1 PortMidi:Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth
1 -1   # buss number, clock status

[midi-meta-events]

# This section defines some features of MIDI meta-event handling.
# Normally, tempo events are supposed to occur in the first track
# (pattern 0).  But one can move this track elsewhere to accomodate
# one's existing body of tunes.  If affects where tempo events are
# recorded.  The default value is 0, the maximum is 1023.
# A pattern must exist at this number for it to work.

0    # tempo_track_number

[midi-input]

0   # number of input MIDI busses

# The first number is the port number, and the second number
# indicates whether it is disabled (0), or enabled (1).


# If set to 1, this option allows the master MIDI bus to record
# (filter) incoming MIDI data by channel, allocating each incoming
# MIDI event to the sequence that is set to that channel.
# This is an option adopted from the Seq32 project at GitHub.

0   # flag to record incoming data by channel

[manual-ports]

# Set to 1 to have seq66 create its own ALSA/JACK ports and not
# connect to other clients.  Use 1 to expose all 16 MIDI ports to
# JACK (e.g. via a2jmidid).  Use 0 to access the ALSA MIDI ports
# already running on one's computer, or to use the autoconnect
# feature (Seq66 connects to existing JACK ports on startup.
# A new feature is to change the number of ports; defaults to 16.

0   # flag for manual (virtual) ALSA or JACK ports
16   # number of manual/virtual ports

[reveal-ports]

# Set to 1 to have seq66 ignore any system port names
# declared in the 'user' configuration file.  Use this option to
# be able to see the port names as detected by ALSA/JACK.

0   # flag for reveal ports

# Set to 1 to allow Seq66 to stay in note-adding mode when
# the right-click is released while holding the Mod4 (Super or
# Windows) key.

0   # allow_mod4_mode

# Set to 1 to allow Seq66 to split performance editor
# triggers at the closest snap position, instead of splitting the
# trigger exactly in its middle.  Remember that the split is
# activated by a middle click.

0   # allow_snap_split

# Set to 1 to allow a double-click on a slot to bring it up in
# the pattern editor.  This is the default.  Set it to 0 if
# it interferes with muting/unmuting a pattern.

1   # allow_click_edit

[jack-transport]

# jack_transport - Enable slave synchronization with JACK Transport.
# Also contains the new flag to use JACK MIDI.

0   # with_jack_transport

# jack_master - Seq66 attempts to serve as JACK Master.
# Also must enable jack_transport (the user interface forces this,
# and also disables jack_master_cond).

0   # with_jack_master

# jack_master_cond - Seq66 is JACK master if no other JACK
# master exists. Also must enable jack_transport (the user interface
# forces this, and disables jack_master).

0   # with_jack_master_cond

# song_start_mode applies to JACK/ALSA/PortMidi.

# 0 = Playback in live mode. Allows muting and unmuting of loops.
#     from the main (patterns) window.  Disables both manual and
#     automatic muting and unmuting from the performance window.
# 1 = Playback uses the song (performance) editor's data and mute
#     controls, regardless of which window was used to start the
#     playback.

0   # song_start_mode

# jack_midi - Enable JACK MIDI, which is a separate option from
# JACK Transport.

0   # with_jack_midi

[auto-option-save]

# Set the following value to 0 to disable the automatic saving of the
# current configuration to the 'rc' and 'user' files.  Set it to 1 to
# follow seq24 behavior of saving the configuration at exit.
# Note that, if auto-save is set, many of the command-line settings,
# such as the JACK/ALSA settings, are then saved to the configuration,
# which can confuse one at first.  Also note that one currently needs
# this option set to 1 to save the configuration, as there is not a
# user-interface control for it at present.

1     # auto-save-options-on-exit support flag
