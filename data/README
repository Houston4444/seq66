This directory contains files to be installed in the ${prefix}/share
directory (e.g. /usr/share or /usr/local/share) on Linux, or in the
installation directory (e.g.  C:/Program Files (x86)/Seq66/data) on
Windows.

The files include alternate configuration files that the user can copy to
$HOME/.config/sequencer64 [or C:/Users/YourName/AppData/Local/seq66 on
Windows] and modify to satisfaction, plus some sample Seq66 MIDI files.
