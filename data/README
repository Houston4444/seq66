Data Directory for Seq66 0.90.4
Chris Ahlstrom
2018-01-02 to 2020-07-07

This directory contains files to be installed in the ${prefix}/share
directory (e.g. /usr/share or /usr/local/share) on Linux, or in the
installation directory (e.g.  C:/Program Files (x86)/Seq66/data) on
Windows.

While Seq66 will create the configuration directory and configuration file
the first time, we also supply some samples.  The files include alternate
configuration files that the user can copy to

    $HOME/.config/seq66                   (Linux)
    C:/Users/YourName/AppData/Local/seq66 (Windows)

and modify to satisfaction, plus some sample Seq66 MIDI files.

# vim: sw=4 ts=4 wm=8 et ft=sh
