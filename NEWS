This file collects major changes that are older and clutter up
the README file.  This file should be called "OLD NEWS".

    -   Version 0.90.4:
        -   Some refactoring to improve Windows builds.
    -   Version 0.90.3:
        -   Added signal handling (e.g. for nsm-proxy) from user falkTX.
            Used in the CLI and Qt versions to trigger file save and
            application exit.
        -   Added code to define the engine used and the exact "uname a-" of the
            operating system on which the build was done, for the --version
            option.
        -   Fixed issue #5 to save/restore note-on resumes and get them
            working in Live mode and Song mode.
        -   Fixed issues with perfoll and grid-button rendering, synch between
            button and seqedit mute status, growing notes in the seqroll, and
            more.
        -   Added writing of blank [midi-control-out] section.
        -   Fixed flickering when muting/unmuting patterns via keystrokes.
    -   Version 0.90.2:
        -   Lots of code cleanup.
        -   Added truncation of BPM to precision in "usr" file.
        -   Fixed at bug in handling running status; backported to Seq64.
    -   Version 0.90.1:
        -   A raft of bug fixes and user-interface improvements.
        -   Many tweaks to try to make the performer and the user-interface even
            faster.
    -   Version 0.90.0:
        -   The application and documentation are now (barely) suitable for
            public consumption, after residing on a server (a Toshiba laptop) at
            home for months.
