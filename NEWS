This file collects major changes that are older and clutter up
the README file.  This file should be called "OLD NEWS".

    -   Version 0.90.2:
        -   Lots of code cleanup.
        -   Added truncation of BPM to precision in "usr" file.
        -   Fixed at bug in handling running status; backported to Seq64.
    -   Version 0.90.1:
        -   A raft of bug fixes and user-interface improvements.
        -   Many tweaks to try to make the performer and the user-interface even
            faster.
    -   Version 0.90.0:
        -   The application and documentation are now (barely) suitable for
            public consumption, after residing on a server (a Toshiba laptop) at
            home for months.
