Sequencer64:

    Snapshot:
        Press:          Save current state; let user change playscreen arming.
        Release:        Restore the saved state.
        Idea:           Can we make restoration cued?
    Mute-Groups:
        Learn mode:     Press button, Ctrl-L, or get MIDI glearn control.
        Save group:     According to selected group number, save current
                        playscreen into group.
        Apply group:    According to event, apply the desired mute group
                        to the playscreen.
        Disable:        Reverse apostrophe
        Enable:         Apostrophe
        Clear:          Remove all mute-groups.  They won't be saved to the MIDI
                        file.  If a change, the user should be a prompt to save
                        the MIDI file.  What about the 'rc' file?  The
                        cleared mute-groups are save.
        Reload:         Reload the mute-groups from the 'rc' file.
    Muting:
        Toggle:         Toggles arming on all patterns?  Or all patterns in
                        playscreen?
        Mute all:       Mute all patterns (in the playscreen?)
        Unmute all:     Unmute all patterns (in the playscreen?)
    Song Mode:          How does it interact with mute groups?
                        Override them?
    Home key:           Set playing screenset.  We don't enable a screenset just
                        because it is in view.  That would cause confusion.  We
                        select a screenset, and when we get to the one we want,
                        we can then enable it.

Processes:

    learn_toggle()
    shift_lock()
    for all seqs in viewscreen, draw_sequence_on_pixmap(); requires getting seq
        pointers by seq number; required iterating through seq events.
    set_song_mode() from various interfaces
    set_screenset()/set_playscreen() and update_screenset()
    set_screenset()/set_viewscreen() and update_screenset()
    Note that multiwid would require multi-view and multi-play screensets!

Sequencer66 Ideas:

    Triggers:

        Move performer::selected_trigger() into triggers.  That class would
        need access to performer to get the sequence pointer.  Same for:
        select_triggers_in_range()
        select_trigger()
        unselect_all_triggers()

    Undo/Redo:

        Can we make classes for these?

    For drawing the various representations of each sequence in a set, provide
    one setmapper function that accepts a functor "void f(int seqnumber)".

    Also need this functionality for a single sequence, all sequences, multiple
    sets, and all sets.

    Mute group toggle in addition to just set.

    Will generally adhere to the above.  And simplify the handling of mute
    groups.

    We want to support the concept of playscreen vs viewscreen.  The playscreen
    would play even in not in view in the GUI.  The visible screen, the
    viewscreen, would not necessarily be playing.  The user could scroll to the
    desired screen, do a bunch of stuff to it, without affecting playing (in Live
    mode).  

    Auto-play:  When a screenset comes into view, it is automatically queued for
    playing.

    All-play:   Turn on the playing of all sets.
